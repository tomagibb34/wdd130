        <h1>Thomas A Gibb | WDD 130 | My Personal Homepage</h1>
        <img src="images/profile.jpg" alt="Hello, my name is Thomas A Gibb" width="200">
        <p>This is one of my favorites, standing in front of the Seattle Temple.
            My name is Tom Gibb, I live with some of our family in Olympia, WA. I grew up in
            Southern
            California and have since moved extensively around the world due to employment.

            I was 80 at the end of September.

            My 2nd wife and I have 12 children (7 for me and 4 for her and one granddaughter
            adopted) between us with one deceased. We have 35 grandchildren and five
            great-grandchildren with one more due in August.

            I started my employment history on 28 August 1963 when I enlisted in the US Navy. 20
            years in the US Navy, (Electronics/Computer/Software/Satellite Communications).
            10 years at Martin Marietta Astronautics Group(MMAG) (Satellite Test Engineer/Software
            Developer/Technical Lead).
            19 years with Intel Corporation (Software/Security/IT Admin/Desktop Support Tech).

            Between the above I had several other small jobs in the Computer and Technology
            industry.

            I retired from the Navy in 1983, MMAG in 1993, and Intel on April 25th, 2016. So, I've
            now been retired for 9 years.

            In addition, my wife and I are Ordnance Workers at the Seattle Temple every Wednesday
            2nd
            shift, so I am almost always busy doing something.</p>
